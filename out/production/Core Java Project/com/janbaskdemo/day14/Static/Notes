Common property value should be made static
static does not belong to objects
Since static does not belongs to objects, we should not call static variable/method using object reference variable

static belongs to class
Since static belongs to objects Class, we should call static variable/method using Class Name directly

We can call non static variables/methods inside static methods using objects

We can call static variables and methods inside non static methods using class name directly

•	Internally method calling of static method [Can be called directly or through class name]
•	Static method calling non-static method [Through Object]
•	Non-static method calling static method [ Through class name]
