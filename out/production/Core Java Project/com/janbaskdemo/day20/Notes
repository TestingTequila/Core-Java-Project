A class cannot have more than one parent CLASS
Method overriding: Two classes that share P-C relationship, the child will inherit parent class property and can override it
                   To check if a method is overridden or not, we use @Override annotation

//Use of final keyword:
  variable as final --> cannot override it value
  method as final   --> cannot override the method
  class as final    --> cannot be inherited or can't be a parent class

  static methods/variables can be inherited but can't be overridden
