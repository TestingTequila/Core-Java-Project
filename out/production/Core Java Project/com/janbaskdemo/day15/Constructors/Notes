Constructor: This construct the default value for global variables


Constructor is used to initialize objects



A
A constructor in Java can not be abstract, final, static, or Synchronized.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Why constructor is a method: because it performs action over class variable just like the methods
Why constructor in Java is a special method
 -because unlike methods its action is already fixed, to assign default value to variables
 -A method can have any name but a constructors name is always same as the name of the class in which it exists
 -A constructor cannot have return type including void
 -We need to call a method whereas a constructor is called automatically the moment we create object of that class

It can be used to set default/initial values for object attributes

 The constructor(s) of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.
 The constructor(s) of a class will not have any return type including void
 Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access i.e which other class can call the constructor.
 The constructor is called when an object of a class is created
