Learn programming - Certain rules of Programming [OOPs Concepts]
-Encapsulation
   -Data Hiding
-Polymorphism
   -method overloading
   -method overriding
-Inheritance
   -Abstraction
   -Interface

-Data Security, code will be less vulnerable
-reusability of the code
-better code designing
-Hide or show your code as per the requirement
-Easy to manage


Polymorphism: Poly --> Many
              Morph --> forms

Mobashir ---> Friends ---> Behave a like a friend
         ---> Parents ---> Behave like Son
         ---> Teacher ---> Behave Like a student
         ----> GF     ---> Behave like a partner

Method Overloading: In a class we can have two or more method with the same name provided their signature is different
 How can we make signature different
                 -By changing the data types of Parameters
                 -By changing the order of parameters
                 -By changing the count of parameters

 Method overloading happens within the same class
   -Compile time Polymorphism
